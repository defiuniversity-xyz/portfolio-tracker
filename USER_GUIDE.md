4. **Organize by Location**: Track where assets are for security awareness
5. **Save Frequently**: Click Save Portfolio after making changes

### Risk Management

1. **Monitor Leverage**: Keep leverage ratio under 2x for safety

4. **Review Regularly**: Check Risk Analysis section at least weekly
5. **Plan for Volatility**: Have deleveraging plans ready for market downturns

### Ladder Strategy Best Practices

6. **Update Regularly**: Recalculate ladders as prices change
7. **Write It Down**: Export or screenshot your ladder plan to track execution

### Debt Management

1. **Pay Off High-Risk First**: Focus on positions close to liquidation
2. **Reduce in Bull Runs**: Take profits to pay down leverage
3. **Calculate Interest**: Factor in borrowing costs
4. **Emergency Plans**: Know your liquidation prices
5. **Buffer Zones**: Keep LTV well below liquidation thresholds
