## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Charts**: Chart.js 4.4.0 (CDN)
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting (Google Cloud Platform)

### Data Structure
```javascript
{
  asset: string,      // Asset ticker (e.g., 'BTC', 'ETH')
  type: string,       // Optional type (e.g., 'Moonwell Lend/Borrow')
  quantity: number,   // Amount held
  price: number,      // Current price per unit
  debt: number,       // Outstanding debt against asset
  location: string    // Storage location
}
```

### Key Calculations
- **Asset Value** = quantity √ó price
- **Net Value** = Asset Value - debt
- **Leverage Ratio** = Total Asset Value √∑ Total Net Value
- **Position %** = (Asset Net Value √∑ Total Net Value) √ó 100

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **No Server Communication**: Application runs entirely in your browser
- **Local Storage Only**: Data persisted using browser localStorage
- **No Analytics**: No tracking or data collection
- **No Authentication**: No user accounts or passwords required
- **Your Data, Your Control**: Clear browser data to reset everything

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### File Structure
```
portfolio-tracker/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html              # Main application file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md              # AI assistant guidance
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # This file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore             # Git ignore rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ firebase.json          # Firebase configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .firebaserc            # Firebase project settings
```

### Making Changes

1. Edit `index.html` with your preferred editor
2. Test changes by opening in browser or using local server
3. Commit changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push origin main
   ```
4. Deploy updates:
   ```bash

### Code Organization

The `index.html` file contains three main sections:
- **HTML** (lines 1-411): Structure and layout
- **CSS** (lines 8-310): Styling with gradient theme
- **JavaScript** (lines 412-845): Application logic

See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed architecture documentation.
